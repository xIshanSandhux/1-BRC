# miniGrep

Initially I was tryying build a mini grep to get used to C++ and trying to optimize it to be as fast and mem efficienct as possible but then I found out about the 1 BRC, and found that it will help me learn more and it seems fun, so yeahh... will be building that now

Prolly will be able to use the old mini grep code ?


## Currently working on
Building the naive approach to read the 1 billion rows and to get the cal done.
